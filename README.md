# ⚙️ MLOPs_Assignment_Option_B: Optimizing the Development & Training Pipeline

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This repository contains an optimized machine learning pipeline for classifying rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures from images. The pipeline automates **environment setup**, **data preprocessing**, and **model training**, all orchestrated through a single entry point: `run_entire_dev_pipeline.py`.

Originally limited to CPU execution with slow preprocessing and suboptimal model performance, this assignment focuses on **GPU acceleration**, **batch optimization**, and **hyperparameter tuning** to significantly improve runtime and model accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

To meet the optimization goals, this project improves on the baseline pipeline by:

- ✅ Reducing **total runtime** to under 1 hour  
- ✅ Achieving a **model accuracy of 97% or higher**  
- ✅ Ensuring full **GPU (CUDA 11.8)** utilization for preprocessing and training  
- ✅ Removing bottlenecks in image preprocessing and training  
- ✅ Maintaining a **modular, readable, and automated** codebase
