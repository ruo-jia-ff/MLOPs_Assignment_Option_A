# ⚙️ MLOPs_Assignment_Option_B: Optimizing the Development & Training Pipeline

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This repository contains an optimized machine learning pipeline for classifying rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures from images. The pipeline automates **environment setup**, **data preprocessing**, and **model training**, all orchestrated through a single entry point: `run_entire_dev_pipeline.py`.

Originally limited to CPU execution with slow preprocessing and suboptimal model performance, this assignment focuses on **GPU acceleration**, **batch optimization**, and **hyperparameter tuning** to significantly improve runtime and model accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

To meet the optimization goals, this project improves on the baseline pipeline by:

- ✅ Reducing **total runtime** to under 1 hour  
- ✅ Achieving a **model accuracy of 97% or higher**  
- ✅ Ensuring full **GPU (CUDA 11.8)** utilization for preprocessing and training  
- ✅ Removing bottlenecks in image preprocessing and training  
- ✅ Maintaining a **modular, readable, and automated** codebase

## 🔍 Pipeline Breakdown

### 📜 `run_entire_dev_pipeline.py`
Main entry point for the entire workflow. It:
- Creates the virtual environment
- Installs dependencies (GPU-compatible)
- Runs dataset extraction and preprocessing
- Triggers model training and export

### 📜 `create_virtual_env.py`
- Creates a Python virtual environment dynamically  
- Installs:
  - `torch` with CUDA 11.8 support  
  - `onnxruntime-gpu`  
  - `rembg` for background removal  
- Automatically extracts `Image_Dataset.zip`  

### 📜 `setup_training.py` ➝ `datautils.py`
- Preprocesses all input images:
  - Resize  
  - Grayscale conversion  
  - **GPU-accelerated background removal** via ONNX  
- Supports **batch processing** for improved performance  

### 📜 `train_model.py` ➝ `model_utils.py`
- Model definition and training loop  
- Uses `torch.device("cuda")` when GPU is available  
- Improved configuration:
  - 15+ epochs  
  - Better learning rate  
  - Enhanced augmentation  
- Exports final model to `output/` in ONNX format
